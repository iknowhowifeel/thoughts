    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    
    <p>the thought of 4 more years of trump sucks. i dread waking up daily with the glaring hyperawareness that the american zeitgeist has not evolved out of its disgusting shell of bigotry. i hold a deep, 
putrid hate for misogynists, racists, xenophobes, and anyone whose concious or subconscious mind believes in stripping other human beings of their humanity. i pity those who couldn't possibly muster
enough agency (a low bar) to vote against evil simply because their comfort is too easy to attach themselves to. <p>

    <p>i am not a conspiracist, and have always practiced calculated optimism (i will continue to do so). although i am now reminded that progressivism is not gaining the traction i thought it was, i dont believe 
that our dictator-to-be is going to be as explicitly rash as some expect; however, im still frustrated and worried. his mere presence cements fanaticism, close-mindedness, and anti-intellectualism. it encourages 
global intolerance and ironically sets back social progress by a significant factor. the most dispiriting aspect isnt just the potential domestic political and economic outcomes, but what they reveal about the 
hidden currents of our social fabric. each step forward in civil rights and social progress seems to be met with some dark fantasy that exhausts the spirit of those fighting for change. </p>
  
    <p>whats particularly wearing is watching the normalization of rhetoric and behavior that is objectively rotten. now more than ever, it seems like select adults cultivate -- quite literally, and often intentionally -- the 
growth of this noxious rhetoric in communities that are most susceptible to it. in unaware hyper-masculine groups, among impressionable youth, even in the funneled minds of techno-optimists and elon fanboys. 
the emboldening of those who would openly express prejudice is normalized under a trump administration. the very notion of truth and expertise has become partisan territory, with facts themselves now subject 
to tribal allegiance rather than objective verification. and this is in part due to the laziness of the fried minds who are too dopamine-addicted and fatigued to see themselves in the third person and realize 
their role in the hive mind. and again, perhaps what's most troubling is not the loud voices of opposition, but the quiet acquiescence of those who know better -- those who recognize the danger but choose 
comfort over confrontation, who value short-term stability over long-term justice. this silent complicity allows the gradual erosion of institutions that, while imperfect, took generations to build. </p>

  <p></p>so yes, elon, america is a nation of builders. but the world i want to build seeks goodness -- it is full of love and human expression. not conspiracy and pathetic intolerance. </p>
